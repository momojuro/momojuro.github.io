Previously majoring in English at the Sorbonne university in Paris, I am now learning how to code while contributing to open source projects on Github during my free time.

Most of those said contributions are related to Android, but I am eager to expand my knowledge into other subfields.

Feel free to contact me via the platforms available on the home page!
